5. You can generate as many passwords as desired by clicking the red "Generate Password" and following the prompts. Each new generated password is displayed in the same location as the last generated password.

    Note: This app does NOT save any generated passwords, so once it is no longer displayed, it is gone forever. I recommend you either copy/paste or write down any generated password you want to use and keep it in a location others cannot find and/or access.
